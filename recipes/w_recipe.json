Break the pieces of butter apart with your fingers and add them to the bowl, then pulse the mixture until the butter is the size of peas or a little smaller. Through the feed tube, drizzle in 3 Tbsp. of the water, continuing to pulse until the mixture just begins to clump together. Continue, very slowly, drizzling in more water, about 1-2 tsp. at a time, until the dough is hydrated enough that it stays together when you compress between your fingers. Dump the mixture into the center of a large sheet of plastic wrap, and using the plastic wrap as a tool, mold and compress the dough into a smooth, compact, flat disc, about \u00bd-inch thick and 6 inches wide. Chill for 1-2 hours or overnight.\nHave a 9-inch deep-dish pie pan (6-cup capacity) nearby.\nRemove the dough from the fridge (If it\u2019s too hard, allow it to rest on the counter for about 20 minutes to come to room temperature), unwrap it, and roll it out between 2 large sheets of parchment paper into a 14-inch round. Remove the top layer of parchment, and pinch any cracks along the edges of the dough together. Lift the bottom piece of parchment with the crust, and invert it onto the pie dish making sure to position it evenly over top, gently lowering it into the bottom edges of the pan. Peel back the parchment and gently adjust the crust. Pinch any remaining cracks together, tuck the overhanging dough underneath itself to create a thick edge, and crimp the edges using your thumbs and index finger. Transfer the entire pan to the freezer for at least 20 minutes to harden.\nHeat the oven to 425 degrees and position the oven rack in the middle of the oven.\nRemove the crust from the freezer and place it on a baking sheet. Take one of the sheets of parchment used for rolling the dough and lay it over the pie. Cover it with pie weights or uncooked beans, spreading the weights out evenly and into the corners. Bake for 25-30 minutes then remove the parchment with weights and bake for another 10-12 minutes, or until the pie is dry and slightly crispy on the bottom. Remove the crust from the oven and allow it to cool to room temperature.\nMake the filling:\nHeat the oven to 325 degrees and place the pie crust on a baking sheet and set it aside.\nAdd the Brown Swerve and coconut cream to the cleaned bowl of a food processor, and blend until smooth, then add the sweet potato, whiskey, vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and salt, and blend until smooth. Then add the eggs, and blend just until completely incorporated. Pour the filling into the cooled crust and bake for 45-55 minutes or until the pie is brown, set on top and around the edges, but the center still jiggles just slightly when the tray is shaken. Remove from the oven and set aside.\nMake the meringue topping:\nInto the bottom of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment add the egg whites and vanilla, and beat on high speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Lower the speed to medium-low and gradually sprinkle in the Swerve Confectioners, stopping to scrape down any Swerve sticking to the sides of the bowl as needed. Once the Swerve is completely incorporated, increase the speed to high and beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form about another 3 minutes. Dollop the meringue over the face of the pie creating peaks and swoops of meringue with the back of your spatula.\nPreheat the oven to broil, and position an oven rack about 9-10 inches from the top coil. Place the pie back onto a sheet tray and into the oven while the oven is heating. As it starts to broil, watch the pie closely and remove it once the meringue is completely toasted and set across the surface, and the tips of the top peaks have turned dark brown, about 4 minutes. Remove from the oven, and allow to come to room temperature completely, preferably overnight, before slicing and serving.\nRecipe by Jerrelle Guy of chocolateforbasil\nWant more?
